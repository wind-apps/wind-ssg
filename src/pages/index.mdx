title: A new static site generator, built with next-gen tooling
---

### Overview

Wind is a new (in-progress) static site generator for Vue - inspired by frameworks like Gridsome, but built on next generation
tooling like Vite and `vite-plugin-ssr`.

It provides similar benefits to other SSG's, but it also differs in that it takes a data-first approach - it supports loading data from
multiple sources (CMS's, Ecommerce platforms etc.) into a central store, and allows you to query that store anywhere in your site
via a GraphQL data layer.

It also has first-class support for templates, so you can create a single template for a particular content type in the datastore,
and Wind will create a page from that template for every single corresponding item in that content type.

#### Features Overview

- Single global data store
- GraphQL data layer, with support for custom schemas
- Templates support
- File based _and_ config based routing
- Support for both pre-rendered HTML-only pages, and Hydrated/SSR pages

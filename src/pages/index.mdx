title: A new SSG
---

### Overview

Wind is a new in-progress static site generator for Vue - inspired by frameworks like Gridsome, but built on next generation tooling like Vite and vite-plugin-ssr.

It provides similar benefits to other SSG's, but it also differs in that it takes a data-first approach - it supports loading data from multiple sources (CMS's, Ecommerce platforms etc.) into a central store, and allows you to query that store anywhere in your site.

It also has first-class support for templates, so you can create a single template for a particular content type in the datastore, and Wind will create a page from that template for every single corresponding content type item.

#### Features Overview

- Single data store
- Templates support
- Pre-rendered data
- File based and config based routing
- Support for both pre-rendered HTML-only pages, and Hydrated/SSR pages
